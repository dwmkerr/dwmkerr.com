However, knowing the basics can help prevent you from getting yourself into a tangle, and can from time to time make certain tasks a little easier.
In this chapter, we'll look at the main features of job control, why it can be a problematic, and some alternatives.

I've seen a few ways of doing this, none of which felt entirely satisfactory. After a bit of experimentation I've come up with a solution which I think really works nicely. This solution avoids having to know in advance how many availability zones we'll support.</description></item><item><title>A portable and magic-free way to open Pull Requests from the Command Line</title><link>http://dwmkerr.com/a-portable-and-magic-free-way-to-open-pull-requests-from-the-command-line/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Oct 2018 09:17:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://dwmkerr.com/a-portable-and-magic-free-way-to-open-pull-requests-from-the-command-line/</guid><description>This little bash snippet will let you open a GitHub or GitLab pull request from the command line on most Unix-like systems (OSX, Ubuntu, etc), without using any magic libraries, ZSH tricks or other dependencies.

No knowledge of Istio is needed, I'll just use it to demonstrate the concepts!
Istio is a highly popular Service Mesh platform which allows engineers to quickly add telemetry, advanced traffic management and more to their service-based applications.
One interesting element of how Istio works is that when deployed into a Kubernetes cluster, many key configuration objects are handled as Custom Resources.</description></item><item><title>Procedural Smiles - Animating SVG with pure JavaScript</title><link>http://dwmkerr.com/procedural-smiles-animating-svg-with-pure-javascript/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jul 2018 23:36:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://dwmkerr.com/procedural-smiles-animating-svg-with-pure-javascript/</guid><description>I recently needed to be able to generate a simple face image, with the face being able to scale from happy to sad.

Microservices became a very popular topic over the last couple of years1. &amp;lsquo;Microservice madness&amp;rsquo; goes something like this:
Netflix are great at devops. Netflix do microservices. Therefore: If I do microservices, I am great at devops.

Controllers Filters Directives Services Views &amp;amp; Routes We‚Äôre not going to be going into detail ‚Äì just taking a look at what each of these components are and where they fit into the structure of an app. We‚Äôll be going into detail for each of them in later articles.</description></item><item><title>Practical AngularJS</title><link>http://dwmkerr.com/practical-angularjs/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2014 14:48:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://dwmkerr.com/practical-angularjs/</guid><description>This series focuses on building applications with AngularJS. It assumes no prior knowledge.
Part 1 ‚Äì Introducing AngularJS
What is AngularJS? What‚Äôs it for and when should we use it? We look into the basics of AngularJS ‚Äì controllers, models and scopes, as well as how to use common directives like ng-model and ng-repeat. We see how client side logic is improved with AngularJS and how we can handle unit testing.</description></item><item><title>AngularJS Promises - The Definitive Guide</title><link>http://dwmkerr.com/promises-in-angularjs-the-definitive-guide/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2014 12:06:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://dwmkerr.com/promises-in-angularjs-the-definitive-guide/</guid><description>Promises are a core feature of AngularJS - whether you understand them or not, if you use AngularJS you've almost certainly been using them for a while.
In this post I'm going to explain what promises are, how they work, where they're used and finally how to use them effectively.
Once we've got the core understanding of promises, we'll look at some more advanced functionality - chaining and resolving promises when routing.</description></item><item><title>Better Specifications</title><link>http://dwmkerr.com/better-specifications/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2014 14:58:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://dwmkerr.com/better-specifications/</guid><description>Specifications are absolutely key to the success of a project.
Unless you have a good definition of what your project is supposed to be, there's no way you can deliver it. A specification is the contract between you and the client, the basis for technical designs, quality assurance test plans, operational readiness, and much more.
I'm not going to talk about how different teams do specs, what works and what doesn't work.</description></item><item><title>Blogging with Ghost</title><link>http://dwmkerr.com/blogging-with-ghost/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2014 04:35:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://dwmkerr.com/blogging-with-ghost/</guid><description>tl;dr Ghost is a blogging platform well worth considering if your blog is all about development.
I've been having some gripes with WordPress as a platform for blogging lately. For development focused blogs like this one, there are some things about it that make writing posts just a little bit clunky. For example:
Syntax Higlightling is always going to use plugins with various shortcode formats. This works, but your raw blog text becomes quite specific to a certain implementation.</description></item><item><title>Practical AngularJS Part 1 ‚Äì Introducing AngularJS</title><link>http://dwmkerr.com/practical-angularjs-part1/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 May 2014 14:48:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://dwmkerr.com/practical-angularjs-part1/</guid><description>In this series of articles I'm going to be working with AngularJS, a fantastic framework from Google that helps you rapidly build web applications. We'll see how AngularJS can be used to speed up your development and help you write cleaner, more testable code.
Introducing AngularJS First of all an introduction is in order.
AngularJS is a lightweight JavaScript framework, primarily for building single page web applications. The idea behind applications like these is that rather than the &amp;lsquo;traditional&amp;rsquo; way of writing web applications which would involve using server side technologies to render the user interface and send it to the user, we handle all of the presentation logic on the client side.</description></item><item><title>Managing Vsix Deployments with Powershell</title><link>http://dwmkerr.com/managing-vsix-deployments-with-powershell/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2014 11:40:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://dwmkerr.com/managing-vsix-deployments-with-powershell/</guid><description>tl;dr - vsix-tools fixes the &amp;lsquo;Invalid Multiple Files in VSIX&amp;rsquo; issue on the Visual Studio Gallery and lets you set vsix version numbers with Powershell.
I maintain a reasonably large project called SharpGL. This project contains two Vsix packages (Visual Studio Extensions), each of which contains project templates for Visual Studio.
If you have ever worked with Vsix files before you might have noticed that the tools for them in Visual Studio seem a little flaky - but even more so is that Visual Studio Gallery site that you have to use to upload your extensions.</description></item><item><title>Practical AngularJS Part 2</title><link>http://dwmkerr.com/practical-angularjs-part-2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2014 15:29:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://dwmkerr.com/practical-angularjs-part-2/</guid><description>I'm going to be working in F# almost exclusively for a short while, so before I throw myself into that I wanted to wind up my Practical AngularJS Part 2 article. It's ready to rock here:

The sessions were great, and since then I've been working on a couple of projects that use Angular.</description></item><item><title>Space Invaders on the CodeProject</title><link>http://dwmkerr.com/space-invaders-on-the-codeproject/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2013 12:24:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://dwmkerr.com/space-invaders-on-the-codeproject/</guid><description>I'm currently writing a series of articles on the CodeProject called &amp;lsquo;Learn JavaScript&amp;rsquo; and am pleased to say that the latest article is available now!

This release has been primarily a bugfixing release, but there is one very useful new feature, the Server Registration Manager tool (srm.exe). This is a standalone application that can be used to install and uninstall SharpShell servers.
srm install server.dll -codebase srm uninstall server.dll This tool makes it much easier to deploy SharpShell servers.</description></item><item><title>ConsoleControl and Happy Coders</title><link>http://dwmkerr.com/consolecontrol-and-happy-coders/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Sep 2013 13:27:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://dwmkerr.com/consolecontrol-and-happy-coders/</guid><description>Sometimes I write up an article and some code on the CodeProject and get a good response, other times it seems an article sinks beneath the waves without any notice.

I'm lost on the root cause of this, but it does seem that the project I'm working on has files set to read-only by something regularly, perhaps Visual Studio is trying to make Git more TFS-y by locking things all over the place.</description></item><item><title>Context Menu for Trello</title><link>http://dwmkerr.com/context-menu-for-trello/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jun 2013 05:40:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://dwmkerr.com/context-menu-for-trello/</guid><description>I'm on holiday at the moment, back in sunny England.

If you're developing addins for multiple versions of Visual Studio - don't use WPF for the Tools &amp;gt; Options windows. It's just noit going to place nice out of the box. This is because there's a lot of property page Win32 stuff going on in the host window that makes it hard to route messages properly - keyboard entry won't work correctly, tab order will be messed up and more, it's just not worth the pain.</description></item><item><title>Introducing Sil</title><link>http://dwmkerr.com/introducing-sil/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jun 2013 15:35:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://dwmkerr.com/introducing-sil/</guid><description>For the last few weeks I've been trying to tie up a project I've been working on for a while called Sil.

Sil is short for &amp;lsquo;See IL&amp;rsquo;, or &amp;lsquo;See Intermediate Language&amp;rsquo;.

These might be xml files with data, assembly references or whatever. Now typically, NUnit will actually copy the files it thinks it needs into a temporary location.

As part of Microsoft's ongoing campaign to reduce the¬†usability¬†of their tools for anyone who isn't working in exactly the way they want, Visual Studio 2012 no longer comes with the ability to create setup and deployment projects.
This is a pretty serious change. For anyone who is developing client applications, then an installer is pretty critical.

The integration of source control directly into Visual Studio seems like a good thing, but even on a well set up network it can occasionally bring Visual Studio to its knees. And I still don't trust its automerge.
Anyway, if you find that the TFS diff and merge tools are just too ugly and odd to work with, there's a great page on the MSDN blogs that describes how to set Visual Studio to use your preferred tool:</description></item><item><title>Go Offline Extension for Visual Studio 2010</title><link>http://dwmkerr.com/go-offline-extension-for-visual-studio-2010/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jun 2012 10:54:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://dwmkerr.com/go-offline-extension-for-visual-studio-2010/</guid><description>Such a useful extension that I just had to big it up - the Go Offline extension adds the following menu item:

Visual Studio 2008/2010
If you need to debug your Visual Studio extension, you may find that Visual Studio itself locks it. This is a real drag - to resolve this issue, add the following as a pre-build step:
if exist "$(TargetPath).locked" del "$(TargetPath).locked" if not exist "$(TargetPath).locked" if exist "$(TargetPath)" move "$(TargetPath)" "$(TargetPath).locked" This will ensure the locked file is moved out of the way first - very useful!</description></item><item><title>Composite Data Service Framework on CodeProject</title><link>http://dwmkerr.com/composite-data-service-framework-on-codeproject/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Nov 2011 11:12:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://dwmkerr.com/composite-data-service-framework-on-codeproject/</guid><description>I have written an article on the CodeProject describing the Composite Data Service Framework project, the article is at:

An Asynchronous Command is a ViewModelCommand - the standard object used in Apex for commanding. However, what is different about this function is that it runs Asynchronously.
One of the problems with running a view model command asynchronously is that generally the view model properties cannot be accessed - as they're created on a different dispatcher.</description></item><item><title>SharpGL 2.0 Beta 1 Released</title><link>http://dwmkerr.com/sharpgl-2-0-beta-1-released/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Oct 2011 04:38:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://dwmkerr.com/sharpgl-2-0-beta-1-released/</guid><description>It's been a long time coming, but the first Beta of SharpGL 2.0 is finally here!

Previously, all rendering in SharpGL was done to a DIB Section, the result of this would be blitted to the screen. Much playing around has shown that in fact this is problematic - rendering to DIB sections can never be hardware accelerated.
To hardware accelerate rendering, the rendering must be to a window or a pixel buffer.</description></item><item><title>P/Invoke Performance</title><link>http://dwmkerr.com/pinvoke-performance/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Sep 2011 13:09:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://dwmkerr.com/pinvoke-performance/</guid><description>SharpGL 2.0 has no P/Invoke - all native functions are called by a C++/CLI class library (OpenGLWrapper if you're getting the code from CodePlex) which calls functions directly. This means there's no more importing of PIXELFORMAT structures and so on.
The thinking behind this was that a C++/CLI wrapper is faster than P/Invoke for a talkative API like OpenGL - but is this actually the case? In my new article on the CodeProject I investigate the performance differences between these two methods.</description></item><item><title>Trials and Tribulations with SharpGL 2.0</title><link>http://dwmkerr.com/trials-and-tribulations-with-sharpgl-2-0/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Sep 2011 06:03:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://dwmkerr.com/trials-and-tribulations-with-sharpgl-2-0/</guid><description>SharpGL has not been updated for a while, the original CoreProject article is at: http://www.codeproject.com/KB/openGL/sharpgl.aspx
