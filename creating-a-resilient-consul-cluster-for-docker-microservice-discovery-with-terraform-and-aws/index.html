We can use this cluster for microservice discovery and management. No prior knowledge of the technologies or patterns is required!</p><p>The final code is at <a href=https://github.com/dwmkerr/terraform-consul-cluster>github.com/dwmkerr/terraform-consul-cluster</a>. Note that it has evolved somewhat since the time of writing, see the Appendices at the end of the article for details.</p><h2 id=consul-terraform--aws>Consul, Terraform & AWS</h2><p><a href=https://www.consul.io/>Consul</a> is a technology which enables <em>Service Discovery</em><sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>, a pattern which allows services to locate each other via a central authority.</p><p><a href=https://www.terraform.io/>Terraform</a> is a technology which allows us to script the provisioning of infrastructure and systems. This allows us to practice the <em>Infrastructure as Code</em> pattern. The rigour of code control (versioning, history, user access control, diffs, pull requests etc) can be applied to our systems.</p><p>And why <a href=https://aws.amazon.com/>AWS</a>? We need to create many servers and build a network to see this system in action. We can simulate parts of this locally with tools such as <a href=https://www.vagrantup.com/>Vagrant</a>, but we can use the arguably most popular<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup> IaaS platfom for this job at essentially zero cost, and learn some valuable skills which are readily applicable to other projects at the same time.</p><p>A lot of what we will learn is not really AWS specific - and the Infrastructure as Code pattern which Terraform helps us apply allows us to apply these techniques easily with other providers.</p><h2 id=the-goal>The Goal</h2><p>The goal is to create a system like this:</p><p><img src=images/img-0-goal.png alt="Overall System Diagram"></p><p>In a nutshell:</p><ul><li>We have a set of homogenous Consul nodes</li><li>The nodes form a cluster and automatically elect a leader</li><li>The nodes span more than one availability zone, meaning the system is redundant and can survive the failure of an entire availability zone (i.e. data centre)</li><li>The Consul UI is available to view via a gateway</li><li>We have two example microservices which register themselves on the cluster, so we can actually see some registered services in the console</li></ul><p>As a quick caveat, in reality this setup would typically live in a private subnet, not directly accessible to the outside work except via public facing load balancers. This adds a bit more complexity to the Terraform setup but not much value to the walk-though. A network diagram of how it might look is below, I invite interested readers to try and move to this model as a great exercise to cement the concepts!</p><h2 id=step-1---creating-our-network>Step 1 - Creating our Network</h2><p>The first logical step is to create the network itself. This means:</p><ul><li>The network (in AWS terminology, this is a <em>VPC</em> or <em>Virtual Private Cloud</em>)</li><li>The &lsquo;public&rsquo; subnet, which defines our IP ranges for hosts</li><li>The internet gateway, which provides an entry/exit point for traffic from/to the internet</li><li>The firewall rules, which define what traffic can come in and out of the network</li></ul><p>All together, that's this:</p><p><img src=images/img-1-network.png alt></p><p>Our solution will be made more resilient by ensuring we host our Consul nodes across multiple <em>availability zones</em><sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup></p><p>Creating a VPC and building a subnet is fairly trivial if you have done some network setup before or spent much time working with AWS, if not, you may be a little lost already. There's a good course on Udemy<sup id=fnref:4><a href=#fn:4 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>4</a></sup> which will take you through the process of setting up a VPC which I recommend if you are interested in this, as it is quite hands on. It'll also show you how to build a more &lsquo;realistic&rsquo; network, which also contains a private subnet and NAT, but that's beyond the scope of this write-up. Instead, I'll take you through the big parts.</p><h3 id=the-network>The Network</h3><p>We're using AWS, we need to create a VPC. A VPC is a Virtual Private Cloud. The key thing is that it is <em>isolated</em>. Things you create in this network will be able to talk to each other if you let them, but cannot communicate with the outside world, unless you specifically create the parts needed for them to do so.</p><p>A private network is probably something you regularly use if you work in a company<sup id=fnref:5><a href=#fn:5 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>5</a></sup>. Most companies have their own internal network - when you use a computer on that network it can talk to other company computers (such as the company mail server). When you are off that network, you might not be able to access your company email (unless it is publicly available, like gmail, or over a VPN [and by accessing a VPN, you are actually <em>joining</em> the network again, albeit remotely]).</p><p>Perhaps the most immediately obvious part of a VPC is that <em>you control the IP addresses</em>. You specify the <em>range</em> of IP addresses which are available to give to machines on the network. When a machine joins, it is given an IP in that range. I'm not going to go into too much detail here, if you are interested let me know and I'll write up an article on VPCs in detail!</p><p><img src=images/img-3-vpc.png alt></p><p>Here's how I'd suggest scripting AWS infrastructure with Terraform if you haven't done this before.</p><ol><li>Use the AWS console to create what you want</li><li>Search the Terraform documentation for the entity you want to create (e.g. <a href=https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/vpc.html>VPC</a>), <em>script</em> the component and <em>apply</em> the provisioning</li><li>Compare the hand-made VPC to the script-made VPC, if the two are the same, you are done</li><li>If the two are different, check the documentation and try again</li></ol><p>Ensure you have an AWS account, and note your Secret Key and Access Key. We'll need these to remotely control it. Here's the terraform script to create a VPC:</p><pre><code>//  Setup the core provider information.
provider &quot;aws&quot; {
  access_key  = &quot;${var.access_key}&quot;
  secret_key  = &quot;${var.secret_key}&quot;
  region      = &quot;${var.region}&quot;
}

//  Define the VPC.
resource &quot;aws_vpc&quot; &quot;consul-cluster&quot; {
  cidr_block = &quot;10.0.0.0/16&quot; // i.e. 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.255.255
  enable_dns_hostnames = true
  tags {
    Name = &quot;Consul Cluster VPC&quot;
    Project = &quot;consul-cluster&quot;
  }
}
</code></pre><p>This script uses <a href=https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html>Terraform Variables</a>, such as <code>var.access_key</code>, which we keep in a <a href=https://github.com/dwmkerr/terraform-consul-cluster/blob/master/variables.tf>variables.tf</a> file. Terraform will use the default values defined in the file if they are present, or ask the user to supply them. Let's build the network:</p><pre><code>terraform apply
</code></pre><p>After supplying the values for the variables, Terraform will provision the network, using the AWS SDK internally.</p><p><img src=images/img-2-terraform-apply.png alt></p><p>You'll see lots of info about what it is creating, then a success message.</p><h3 id=the-public-subnet>The Public Subnet</h3><p>You don't put hosts directly into a VPC, they need to go into a structure called a &lsquo;subnet&rsquo;, which is a <em>part</em> of a VPC. Subnets get their own subset of the VPC's available IP addresses, which you specify.</p><p>Subnets are used to build <em>zones</em> in a network. Why would you need this? Typically it is to manage security. You might have a &lsquo;public zone&rsquo; in which all hosts can be accessed from the internet, and a &lsquo;private zone&rsquo; which is inaccessible directly (and therefore a better location for hosts with sensitive data). You might have an &lsquo;operator&rsquo; zone, which only sysadmins can access, but they can use to get diagnostic information.</p><p>Here's a common subnet layout for multi-tiered applications:</p><p><img src=images/img-4-subnets.png alt></p><p>The defining characteristics of zones is that they are used to create <em>boundaries</em> to isolate hosts. These boundaries are normally secured by firewalls, traversed via gateways or NATs etc. We're going to create two public subnets, one in each of the availability zones<sup id=fnref:5><a href=#fn:5 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>5</a></sup>:</p><pre><code>//  Create a public subnet for each AZ.
resource &quot;aws_subnet&quot; &quot;public-a&quot; {
  vpc_id            = &quot;${aws_vpc.consul-cluster.id}&quot;
  cidr_block        = &quot;10.0.1.0/24&quot; // i.e. 10.0.1.0 to 10.0.1.255
  availability_zone = &quot;ap-southeast-1a&quot;
  map_public_ip_on_launch = true
}
resource &quot;aws_subnet&quot; &quot;public-b&quot; {
  vpc_id            = &quot;${aws_vpc.consul-cluster.id}&quot;
  cidr_block        = &quot;10.0.2.0/24&quot; // i.e. 10.0.2.0 to 10.0.1.255
  availability_zone = &quot;ap-southeast-1b&quot;
  map_public_ip_on_launch = true
}
</code></pre><p>With Terraform, resources can depend on each other. In this case, the subnets need to reference the ID of the VPC we want to place them in (so we use <code>aws_vpc.consul-cluster.id</code>).</p><h3 id=the-internet-gateway-route-tables-and-security-groups>The Internet Gateway, Route Tables and Security Groups</h3><p>The final parts of the network you can see in the <a href=https://github.com/dwmkerr/terraform-consul-cluster/blob/master/network.tf>./infrastructure/network.tf</a> script. These are the Internet Gateway, Route Table and Security Group resources. Essentially they are for controlling access between hosts and the internet. AWS have a <a href=http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Scenario1.html>good guide</a> if you are not familiar with these resources; they don't add much to the article so I'll leave you to explore on your own.</p><p>That's it for the network, we now have the following structure:</p><p><img src=images/img-1-network-1.png alt></p><p>If you want to see the code as it stands now, check the <a href=https://github.com/dwmkerr/terraform-consul-cluster/tree/step-1>Step 1</a> branch. Now we need to look at creating the hosts to install Consul on.</p><h2 id=step-2---creating-the-consul-hosts>Step 2 - Creating the Consul Hosts</h2><p>The Consul documentation recommends running in a cluster or 3 or 5 nodes<sup id=fnref:6><a href=#fn:6 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>6</a></sup>. We want to set up a system which is self-healing - if we lose a node, we want to create a new one.</p><p>Enter <a href=http://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/latest/userguide/AutoScalingGroup.html>Auto-Scaling Groups</a>. Auto-scaling groups allow us to define a template for an instance, and ask AWS to make sure there are always a certain number of these instances. If we lose an instance, a new one will be created to keep the group at the correct size<sup id=fnref:7><a href=#fn:7 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>7</a></sup>.</p><p>So we now need to create:</p><ol><li>A &lsquo;Launch Configuration&rsquo; which determines what instances our Auto-scaling Group creates</li><li>A &lsquo;user data script&rsquo; which runs on newly created instances, which must install and start Consul</li><li>An Auto-scaling group, configured to run five instances across the two public subnets</li><li>A load balancer, configured to pass incoming requests for the Consul Admin console to the nodes</li></ol><p>Or visually:</p><p><img src=images/img-5-cluster-basic-2.png alt="Basic Cluster Diagram"></p><p>Let's get to it.</p><h3 id=the-launch-configuration--auto-scaling-group>The Launch Configuration & Auto-scaling Group</h3><p>The Launch Configuration will define the characteristics of our instances and the auto-scaling group determines the size of our cluster:</p><pre><code>//  Launch configuration for the consul cluster auto-scaling group.

</code></pre></div><p>Here's a breakdown of what we're doing:</p><ol><li>Install Docker. These scripts run as root, so we add the ec2-user to the Docker group, meaning when we log in later on via SSH, we can run Docker</li><li>Get our IP address. AWS provide a magic address (169.254.169.254) which lets you query data about your instance, see <a href=http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html>Instance Metadata & User Metadata</a></li><li>Run the Consul docker image in server mode, with the UI enabled, expecting only one instance</li></ol><p><strong>The actual scripts contains more!</strong> Getting userdata scripts right, testing and debugging them is tricky. See how I do it in detail in <a href=#Appendix-1-Logging>Appendix 1: Logging</a>.</p><p>Now we need to tell Terraform to include this script as part of the instance metadata. Here's how we do that:</p><pre><code>resource &quot;aws_launch_configuration&quot; &quot;consul-cluster-lc&quot; {
    /// ...add the line below....
    user_data = &quot;${file(&quot;files/consul-node.sh&quot;)}&quot;
}
</code></pre><p>When Consul is running with the <code>-ui</code> option, it provides an admin UI. You can try it by running Consul locally with <code>docker run -p8500:8500 consul</code> and navigating to http://localhost:8500/ui.</p><p>We can install a load balancer in front of our auto-scaling group, to automatically forward incoming traffic to a host. Here's the config:</p><pre><code>resource &quot;aws_elb&quot; &quot;consul-lb&quot; {
    name = &quot;consul-lb-a&quot;
    security_groups = [
        &quot;${aws_security_group.consul-cluster-vpc.id}&quot;,
        &quot;${aws_security_group.web.id}&quot;
    ]
    subnets = [
        &quot;${aws_subnet.public-a.id}&quot;,
        &quot;${aws_subnet.public-b.id}&quot;
    ]
    listener {
        instance_port = 8500
        instance_protocol = &quot;http&quot;
        lb_port = 80
        lb_protocol = &quot;http&quot;
    }
    health_check {
        healthy_threshold = 2
        unhealthy_threshold = 2
        timeout = 3
        target = &quot;HTTP:8500/ui/&quot;
        interval = 30
    }
}
</code></pre><p>Blow-by-blow:</p><ol><li>Create a load balancer, with the same security groups as the rest of the VPC, but also a security group which allows web access</li><li>Point to two subnets first subnet</li><li>Forward HTTP 8500 traffic</li><li>Configure a healthcheck<sup id=fnref:9><a href=#fn:9 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>9</a></sup></li></ol><p>The final change we make is to add an <code>outputs.tf</code> file, which lists all of the properties Terraform knows about which we want to save. All it includes is:</p><pre><code>output &quot;consul-dns&quot; {
    value = &quot;${aws_elb.consul-lb.dns_name}&quot;
}
</code></pre><p>When we finally run <code>terraform apply</code>, we see the public DNS of our load balancer:</p><p><img src=images/img-8-cluster-dns.png alt="Screenshot showing &lsquo;terraform apply&rsquo; output, indicating our newly generated ELB's public DNS"></p><p>And running in a browser on port 8500 we see the Consul admin interface:</p><p><img src=images/img-9-admin-ui.png alt="Screenshot showing the Consul admin interface"></p><p>Every time we refresh we will likely see a different node. We've actually created five clusters each of one node - what we now need to do is connect them all together into a single cluster of five nodes.</p><p>If you want to see the code as it stands now, check the <a href=https://github.com/dwmkerr/terraform-consul-cluster/tree/step-2>Step 2</a> branch.</p><h2 id=step-3---creating-the-cluster>Step 3 - Creating the Cluster</h2><p>Creating the cluster is now not too much of a challenge. We will update the userdata script to tell the consul process we are expecting 5 nodes (via the <a href=https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/options.html#_bootstrap_expect><code>bootstrap-expect</code></a> flag.</p><p>Here's the updated script:</p><pre><code># Get my IP address.
IP=$(curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/local-ipv4)
echo &quot;Instance IP is: $IP&quot;

# Start the Consul server.
docker run -d --net=host \
    --name=consul \
    consul agent -server -ui \
    -bind=&quot;$IP&quot; \
    -client=&quot;0.0.0.0&quot; \
    -bootstrap-expect=&quot;5&quot;
</code></pre><p>The problem is <strong>this won't work</strong>&mldr; We need to tell each node the address of <em>another</em> server in the cluster. For example, if we start five nodes, we should tell nodes 2-5 the address of node 1, so that the nodes can discover each other.</p><p>The challenge is how do we get the IP of node 1? The IP addresses are determined by the network, we don't preset them so cannot hard code them.

Our load balancer will notice the nodes are unhealthy and stop forwarding traffic. Our auto-scaling group will see the nodes have terminated and create two new ones, which will join the cluster in the same way as the original nodes. Once they join, the load balancer will find them healthy and bring them back into rotation.</p><p>We can see from the load balancer monitoring that it notices we have unhealthy nodes and also notices when new ones come into service:</p><p><img src=images/img-18-recovery-1.png alt="Screenshot showing the load balancer monitoring"></p><p>A quick check of the admin dashboard shows we now have a recovered system, with five healthy nodes:</p><p><img src=images/img-18b-recovered.png alt="Screenshot showing recovered system"></p><p>The nodes which were terminated are still listed as failing.
