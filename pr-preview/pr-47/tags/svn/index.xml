The integration of source control directly into Visual Studio seems like a good thing, but even on a well set up network it can occasionally bring Visual Studio to its knees. And I still don't trust its automerge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, if you find that the TFS diff and merge tools are just too ugly and odd to work with, there's a great page on the MSDN blogs that describes how to set Visual Studio to use your preferred tool:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome back TortoiseMerge, I've missed you.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>CodeProject</category></item><item><title>Getting Source Code Metrics from SVN</title><link>https://dwmkerr.github.io/dwmkerr.com/pr-preview/pr-47/getting-source-code-metrics-from-svn/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Nov 2011 07:55:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dwmkerr.github.io/dwmkerr.com/pr-preview/pr-47/getting-source-code-metrics-from-svn/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Lets say that we need to find out how many lines of code exist in a branch, or how many lines are checked in by a specific user. Let's ignore the usefulness of these metrics, just assume that they're needed (realistically, lines of code isn't a very useful metric, but perhaps you want to have a quick idea of how much has gone into a release). How do we do this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TortoiseSVN statistics aren't really enough. Here's some alternatives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SVNPlot&lt;br /&gt;Theoretically should give us graphs. Runs in python. Couldn't get it to work in five minutes so moved on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/svnplot/"&gt;http://code.google.com/p/svnplot/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;StatSVN&lt;br /&gt;Much more respected than the above, runs through Java. Again, didn't have results in five minutes to moved on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.statsvn.org/"&gt;http://www.statsvn.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FishEye&lt;br /&gt;Very powerful but it's not free. Generates a lot of information that you can use to analyse your repositories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/fisheye/overview?gclid=CN6cw4WptqwCFQRP4QodnCtcGg"&gt;http://www.atlassian.com/software/fisheye/overview?gclid=CN6cw4WptqwCFQRP4QodnCtcGg&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd recommend taking a look at FishEye if you're going to go to the effort of getting these statistics. Any comments on alternatives would be welcome!&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>CodeProject</category></item></channel></rss>
