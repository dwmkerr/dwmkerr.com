We can use this cluster for microservice discovery and management. No prior knowledge of the technologies or patterns is required!
The final code is at github.com/dwmkerr/terraform-consul-cluster. Note that it has evolved somewhat since the time of writing, see the Appendices at the end of the article for details.
Consul, Terraform &amp;amp; AWS Consul is a technology which enables Service Discovery1, a pattern which allows services to locate each other via a central authority.</description></item></channel></rss>
