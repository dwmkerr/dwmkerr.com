https://effective-shell.com
The whole site is built from a GitHub repo at github.com/dwmkerr/effective-shell. It is open for contributions, changes, issues and suggestions. I've also added a comment section to each page to get input.
To keep the material as accessible as possible, I have added a new section for beginners, to help anyone who has not used a shell before.</description></item><item><title>Effective Shell Part 7: The Subtleties of Shell Commands</title><link>https://dwmkerr.com/effective-shell-7-shell-commands/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jun 2019 07:25:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dwmkerr.com/effective-shell-7-shell-commands/</guid><description>In this chapter, we'll take a look at the various different types of shell commands that exist and how this can affect your work.
