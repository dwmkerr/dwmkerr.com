I maintain a reasonably large project called SharpGL. This project contains two Vsix packages (Visual Studio Extensions), each of which contains project templates for Visual Studio.
If you have ever worked with Vsix files before you might have noticed that the tools for them in Visual Studio seem a little flaky - but even more so is that Visual Studio Gallery site that you have to use to upload your extensions.</description></item><item><title>WPF and Visual Studio Addins</title><link>http://dwmkerr.com/wpf-and-visual-studio-addins/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jun 2013 01:36:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://dwmkerr.com/wpf-and-visual-studio-addins/</guid><description>If at all possible nowadays, I write all my Windows UI code in WPF, it's just quicker and easier than WinForms. Recently however, I came across a situation that you should just avoid.
If you're developing addins for multiple versions of Visual Studio - don't use WPF for the Tools &amp;gt; Options windows. It's just noit going to place nice out of the box. This is because there's a lot of property page Win32 stuff going on in the host window that makes it hard to route messages properly - keyboard entry won't work correctly, tab order will be messed up and more, it's just not worth the pain.</description></item></channel></rss>
