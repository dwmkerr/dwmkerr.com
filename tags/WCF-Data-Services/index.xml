http://blogs.msdn.com/b/alexj/archive/2010/01/08/creating-a-data-service-provider-part-3-metadata.aspx
And you notice that your entities are not showing up in the $metadata file, double check that you have added this:
public class service : MyNewDataService { // This method is called only once to initialize service-wide policies. public static void InitializeService(DataServiceConfiguration config) { config.SetEntitySetAccessRule("*", EntitySetRights.AllRead); config.DataServiceBehavior.MaxProtocolVersion = DataServiceProtocolVersion.V2; } } Just remember to set the entity set access rules for all entities - other they won't show up!</description></item><item><title>Composite Data Service Framework</title><link>http://dwmkerr.com/composite-data-service-framework/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Nov 2011 11:02:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://dwmkerr.com/composite-data-service-framework/</guid><description>Today I start a new project - the Composite Data Service Framework.&amp;nbsp;The Composite Data Service Framework is a project that aims to obviate some of the limitations of WCF Data Services, specifically:
Allowing multiple data services to be aggregated in a single data service. Providing more support for Service Operations (such as auto-generation of proxies client-side). Aggregating different service types (entity framework, CLR types etc) Complementing OData services with traditional WCF services with a single definition of proxies client-side.</description></item><item><title>Data Service Exception "Unauthorised" when connecting to Sharepoint OData</title><link>http://dwmkerr.com/data-service-exception-unauthorised-when-connecting-to-sharepoint-odata/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Nov 2011 10:28:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://dwmkerr.com/data-service-exception-unauthorised-when-connecting-to-sharepoint-odata/</guid><description>If you are struggling to fetch data from a Sharepoint OData service and getting an error as below:
[DataServiceClientException: Unauthorized] System.Data.Services.Client.QueryResult.Execute() +436914 System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceRequest.Execute(DataServiceContext context, QueryComponents queryComponents) +133&amp;nbsp; Then ensure you are setting the Credentials property of your Data Service Context, as below:
// Create the data context. SharepointDataContext dc = new SharepointDataContext(new Uri("http://dksp/_vti_bin/listdata.svc")); // Provide default credentials, without this authorisation will fail! dc.Credentials = System.Net.CredentialCache.DefaultCredentials;
// Etc&amp;hellip; var accounts = from a in dc.</description></item><item><title>The "Name attribute is invalid" when adding a Service Reference to a Sharepoint OData Service</title><link>http://dwmkerr.com/the-name-attribute-is-invalid-when-adding-a-service-reference-to-a-sharepoint-odata-service/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Nov 2011 10:19:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://dwmkerr.com/the-name-attribute-is-invalid-when-adding-a-service-reference-to-a-sharepoint-odata-service/</guid><description>Well this little issue took me a while to investigate, but the skinny is this:
If you are going to add a service reference to a Sharepoint OData service (e.g.&amp;nbsp;http://sharepoint/_vti_bin/listdata.svc) then make sure your Sharepoint site name does NOT begin with a number - otherwise Visual Studio will fail to add the reference.
Quick and easy, but this took quite a while for me to find, hope it helps anyone in the same situation!</description></item></channel></rss>
