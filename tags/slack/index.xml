The Problem The scenario can be roughly simplified to this:
We are building a mobile app and application server. This will take data from a user, transform it and then pass it to the enterprise system processing.
The problem is that the enterprise system doesn't exist yet!
Now this is not too much of a challenge, the first thing we did was build a simple mock of the enterprise system in Node.</description></item></channel></rss>
