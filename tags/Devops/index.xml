By the end of this chapter, you might even be able to make sense of the horrifying and perfectly syntactically valid code below:

However, knowing the basics can help prevent you from getting yourself into a tangle, and can from time to time make certain tasks a little easier.
In this chapter, we'll look at the main features of job control, why it can be a problematic, and some alternatives.

No knowledge of Istio is needed, I'll just use it to demonstrate the concepts!
Istio is a highly popular Service Mesh platform which allows engineers to quickly add telemetry, advanced traffic management and more to their service-based applications.
One interesting element of how Istio works is that when deployed into a Kubernetes cluster, many key configuration objects are handled as Custom Resources.</description></item><item><title>Patching Kubernetes Resources in Golang</title><link>https://dwmkerr.github.io/dwmkerr.com/patching-kubernetes-resources-in-golang/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jul 2018 06:33:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dwmkerr.github.io/dwmkerr.com/patching-kubernetes-resources-in-golang/</guid><description>Recently I needed to be able to quickly adjust the number of replicas in a Kubernetes Replication Controller. The original solution I'd seen pulled down the spec, modified it, then updated it. There's a better way!
There's a patch API for Kubernetes resources. Patching resources is faster and easier than pulling them and updating the spec wholesale. However, the documentation is a little limited.
After some trial and error I got it working, here's the solution.</description></item><item><title>mongo-monitor - a simple CLI to monitor your MongoDB cluster</title><link>https://dwmkerr.github.io/dwmkerr.com/mongo-monitor-cli/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 May 2018 20:09:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dwmkerr.github.io/dwmkerr.com/mongo-monitor-cli/</guid><description>The mongo-monitor CLI is a lean and simple tool to check the status of a MongoDB server or cluster. The code is on GitHub:
github.com/dwmkerr/mongo-monitor
Here's how it looks in action:
In this animation I am monitoring a simple sharded cluster, and running some example maintenance operations, adding a node to a replicaset, stepping down a primary and shutting down a replicaset node.
A simple CLI which shows the status in real-time can be very useful to keep open when performing admin, letting you see how your changes affect the cluster as you work on it.</description></item><item><title>The Death of Microservice Madness in 2018</title><link>https://dwmkerr.github.io/dwmkerr.com/the-death-of-microservice-madness-in-2018/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jan 2018 10:52:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dwmkerr.github.io/dwmkerr.com/the-death-of-microservice-madness-in-2018/</guid><description>En Espa√±ol | Reddit Thread | Hacker News Thread
Microservices became a very popular topic over the last couple of years1. &amp;lsquo;Microservice madness&amp;rsquo; goes something like this:
Netflix are great at devops. Netflix do microservices. Therefore: If I do microservices, I am great at devops.
There are many cases where great efforts have been made to adopt microservice patterns without necessarily understanding how the costs and benefits will apply to the specifics of the problem at hand.</description></item><item><title>Simple Continuous Integration for Docker Images</title><link>https://dwmkerr.github.io/dwmkerr.com/simple-continuous-integration-for-docker-images/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Nov 2016 05:14:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dwmkerr.github.io/dwmkerr.com/simple-continuous-integration-for-docker-images/</guid><description>In this article I'm going to demonstrate a few tips and tricks which can make your life easier when you are building or maintaining Dockerfiles.
The need for a Build Pipeline Do we really need any kind of continuous integration or build pipeline for Dockerfiles?
There will be cases when the answer is no. However, if the answer to any of the following questions is &amp;lsquo;yes&amp;rsquo;, it might be worth considering:</description></item><item><title>Learn Docker by building a Microservice</title><link>https://dwmkerr.github.io/dwmkerr.com/learn-docker-by-building-a-microservice/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Apr 2016 08:54:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dwmkerr.github.io/dwmkerr.com/learn-docker-by-building-a-microservice/</guid><description>If you are looking to get your hands dirty and learn all about Docker, then look no further!
In this article I'm going to show you how Docker works, what all the fuss is about, and how Docker can help with a basic development task - building a microservice.
We'll use a simple Node.js service with a MySQL backend as an example, going from code running locally to containers running a microservice and database.</description></item></channel></rss>
