Why might this be? Well image the situation that you are exporting data into an intermediate schema, you only want to import data from a certain date range and due to this you have only a subset of the records. You need this subset for analysis but you don't care about referential integrity - in fact if it is on then constraints will be violated.</description></item><item><title>Using imp or exp as a SYSDBA</title><link>https://dwmkerr.com/using-imp-or-exp-as-a-sysdba/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Feb 2012 07:21:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dwmkerr.com/using-imp-or-exp-as-a-sysdba/</guid><description>One of the things that I regularly forget is the syntax for running imp or exp for Oracle and specifying a SYSDBA user. As a quick hint, here's the syntax:
imp '"sys/pass@TNS as sysdba"' FILE=file.exp An easy thing to forget!</description></item></channel></rss>
