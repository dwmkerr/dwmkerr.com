I've been operating Kubernetes in multiple environments for a few years now. I thought this would be an easy certification to get, but I was surprised by how hard it was!
I took this exam without doing any formal training, I mostly focused on the areas of the curriculum which I knew I was a little weak at.</description></item><item><title>Supercharge your Java Projects with Conventional Commits, Semantic Versioning and Semantic Releases</title><link>https://dwmkerr.com/conventional-commits-and-semantic-versioning-for-java/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dwmkerr.com/conventional-commits-and-semantic-versioning-for-java/</guid><description>In this article we'll look at a few simple techniques which can really supercharge your Java project and make them much easier to work with!

However, knowing the basics can help prevent you from getting yourself into a tangle, and can from time to time make certain tasks a little easier.
In this chapter, we'll look at the main features of job control, why it can be a problematic, and some alternatives.

I've seen a few ways of doing this, none of which felt entirely satisfactory. After a bit of experimentation I've come up with a solution which I think really works nicely. This solution avoids having to know in advance how many availability zones we'll support.</description></item><item><title>A portable and magic-free way to open Pull Requests from the Command Line</title><link>https://dwmkerr.com/a-portable-and-magic-free-way-to-open-pull-requests-from-the-command-line/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Oct 2018 09:17:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dwmkerr.com/a-portable-and-magic-free-way-to-open-pull-requests-from-the-command-line/</guid><description>This little bash snippet will let you open a GitHub or GitLab pull request from the command line on most Unix-like systems (OSX, Ubuntu, etc), without using any magic libraries, ZSH tricks or other dependencies.

No knowledge of Istio is needed, I'll just use it to demonstrate the concepts!
Istio is a highly popular Service Mesh platform which allows engineers to quickly add telemetry, advanced traffic management and more to their service-based applications.
One interesting element of how Istio works is that when deployed into a Kubernetes cluster, many key configuration objects are handled as Custom Resources.</description></item><item><title>Procedural Smiles - Animating SVG with pure JavaScript</title><link>https://dwmkerr.com/procedural-smiles-animating-svg-with-pure-javascript/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jul 2018 23:36:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dwmkerr.com/procedural-smiles-animating-svg-with-pure-javascript/</guid><description>I recently needed to be able to generate a simple face image, with the face being able to scale from happy to sad.

There's a patch API for Kubernetes resources. Patching resources is faster and easier than pulling them and updating the spec wholesale. However, the documentation is a little limited.

A simple CLI which shows the status in real-time can be very useful to keep open when performing admin, letting you see how your changes affect the cluster as you work on it.</description></item><item><title>The Death of Microservice Madness in 2018</title><link>https://dwmkerr.com/the-death-of-microservice-madness-in-2018/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jan 2018 10:52:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dwmkerr.com/the-death-of-microservice-madness-in-2018/</guid><description>En Español | Reddit Thread | Hacker News Thread
Microservices became a very popular topic over the last couple of years1. &amp;lsquo;Microservice madness&amp;rsquo; goes something like this:
Netflix are great at devops. Netflix do microservices. Therefore: If I do microservices, I am great at devops.
There are many cases where great efforts have been made to adopt microservice patterns without necessarily understanding how the costs and benefits will apply to the specifics of the problem at hand.</description></item><item><title>Effective Shell Part 3: Getting Help</title><link>https://dwmkerr.com/effective-shell-part-3-getting-hepl/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Dec 2017 09:05:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dwmkerr.com/effective-shell-part-3-getting-hepl/</guid><description>This is the third part of my Effective Shell series - practical examples of ways to be more efficient with everyday tasks in a shell.

The problem is that the enterprise system doesn't exist yet!
