"you can use the 60+ WordPress and Montezuma PHP functions, see the button \"Limited PHP code\" \n"

"A CSS Grid system is of a bunch of predefined CSS classes (<code>row</code>, <code>col1</code>, \n"

msgid ""
"Each one of these 12 classes represents a certain predefined width.\n"
"<br><br>\n"
"The actual, exact width value and the width unit (pixels or percent) depend  \n"
"on the CSS Grid being used. <code>col3</code> is always approximately \"one fourth\" because \"3\" is \"one fourth of 12\".  \n"
"Or, in other words, and for a grid that is 960 pixels wide, <code>col3</code> is 960 pixels / 12 * <strong>3</strong> = 240 pixels.  \n"
"However, the exact width will usually be slightly smaller because a small fraction of the available row width \n"
"is needed for the margin between the columns. \n"
"<br><br>\n"
"Except if you use a CSS Grid with no margin between columns at all, such as \n"
"<code>Responsive 960px. Margin 0</code> or <code>960px. Margin 0</code> (See \"Choose CSS Grid\"). In a CSS Grid with \n"
"more margin between columns -  e.g. the <code>Responsive 960px. Margin 48px</code> Grid - \n"
"the actual width of the columns will be smaller \n"
"than in a Grid with less margin between columns such as the <code>Responsive 960px. Margin 0</code> Grid. Bigger margins \n"
"consume more of the available total width of a row (960 pixels or 100%), leaving less width to the columns.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<h3>Why not just use actual values for the column widths?</h3> \n"
"<p  class=\"colcount3\">\n"
"For one, you don't need to do complicated \n"
"maths such as adding and substracting numbers like \"214\", \"139\", \"712\". The only math you do is to make sure \n"
"that those numbers in the col<strong>X</strong> column classes always add up to 12 within the same row. Then, CSS Grids \n"
"make creating \"Responsive\" layouts much easier. Advantage 3: Easy \"source ordering\" for possible SEO benefits. Finally,\n"
"these CSS Grids provide more than just the width of columns, they also deal with everything else needed to \n"
"create a layout.    \n"
"</p>\n"
"<h3>So, the CSS Grid columns have predefined widths. What if I need columns with exact, custom widths?</h3>\n"
"<p  class=\"colcount3\">\n"
"A disadvantage of CSS Grids is that custom widths aren't built in. However you CAN still have \n"
"custom widths, by doing whatever you would have done to create custom column width if you were not using a Grid, \n"
"such as providing actual pixel or percent width values for the columns, either inline (putting the CSS \n"
"right on the element, in a template) or in one of the CSS files (such as <code>layout.css</code> or <code>various.css</code>). \n"
"The CSS Grid isn't taking away that possibility. You can even put a width value on a \n"
"column that is part of a CSS Grid row. In that case you should put width values on <strong>all</strong> columns in that row. \n"
"You will also have to make sure that all column widths plus the margins between the columns add up to the row width, \n"
"which usually is 960 pixels in pixel based Grids and 100% in percent based Grids. (10 pixel and 10 percent Grids are \n"
"included in Montezuma).   \n"
"Paddings inside the columns and borders on the columns do not add to the width of a column and thus do not affect the total \n"
"row width, because the global CSS rule <code>box-sizing: border-box;</code> applies to all HTML elements in Montezuma, \n"

"</p>\n"
"<h3>box-sizing: border-box</h3>\n"
"<p  class=\"colcount3\">\n"
"All Grids use <code>box-sizing: border-box</code> as do <strong>all</strong> HTML elements in Montezuma. \n"
"In other words * everything * is set to <code>box-sizing: border-box</code>.  \n"
"This means the width of HTML elements is calculated in a more reasonable, human way by counting the padding \n"
"(\"inner space\") and the border of an element to its total width. \n"
"<br><br>\n"
"So if you add padding or borders to \n"
"an element it doesn't change its width, instead the content inside the element gets narrowed a bit to make \n"
"room for the padding or border.  \n"
"This means you can apply borders and padding right on the column DIV's without affecting the column widths\n"
"(Margin would still affect the column width).  \n"
"<br><br>\n"
"In traditional CSS Grids doing this * would * affect the column widths, the column would get too wide and the \n"
"right-most column would \"drop down\" all the way to the bottom of the layout. In traditional CSS Grids this \n"
"is fixed by putting another extra DIV (important: without specified width) inside each column DIV. \n"
"But this increases the amount of DIV's by 1 extra DIV for each column, and thus \n"
"pollutes your source code with unnecessary code leading to a less optimal \"noise to signal ratio\". \n"
"<br><br>\n"
"The only downside is that <code>box-sizing: border-box</code> is only supported natively by IE8 and up, however \n"
"as of July 2012 IE7 is at 2-3% market share and dropping at a fast rate so it should be at 1% and less by the end of 2012 / early 2013 . \n"
"For the sake of building for the future and now, and for keeping the code clean instead of carrying around numerous \n"
