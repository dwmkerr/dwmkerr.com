# Casper
A Ghost-like WordPress theme

Casper *(for WordPress)* is a simple yet beautiful theme for bloggers.

Inspired by the [Ghost](http://ghost.org) blogging platform, Casper is a [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) port of the [default theme by the same name](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper). The goal of this project is to emulate the gorgeous theme while taking advantage of features exclusive to the WordPress framework. There are plenty of customization options included, accessible through the WordPress Customizer. Already included are hooks to serve responsive images appropriately and media queries to provide a fast and seamless experience from desktop to mobile.

### [Demo](http://lacymorrow.com/projects/casper/)

## Usage

Download the [zip](https://github.com/lacymorrow/casper-wp/archive/master.zip) package of the theme and install either automatically through the WordPress Dashboard > Appearance tab, or by uploading the `casper-wp` folder to your WordPress/wp-content/themes directory.


#### Using Grunt to build the package

A `gruntfile.js` is included. `cd` into the theme directory and run `npm install` to install Grunt and all dependencies locally. Run `grunt` to build or `grunt watch` to continuously build.

###### Tasks

 * Compile `src/css/style.less` and other LESS and CSS files in `src/css/`
 * Any CSS is combed, linted, prefixed, then compiled with `css/style.css`
 * `css/style.css` is minified into `style.css`
 * Images in `src/img/` are compressed and copied to `img`
 * Theme JavaScript and other js files in `src/js/` are linted, minified, and combined into `js/main.js`
