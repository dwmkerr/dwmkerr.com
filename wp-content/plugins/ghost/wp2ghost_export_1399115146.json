You can use Build Buttons to create Facebook 'Like' or 'Follow' buttons, LinkedIn 'Share' buttons, Google +1 buttons, GitHub Star, Fork and Follow buttons and more. Here's how it works.\r\n\r\nFirst, go to <a title=\"Build Buttons\" href=\"http:\/\/www.buildbuttons.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.buildbuttons.com<\/a>:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.dwmkerr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/buildbuttons.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-302\" alt=\"Build Buttons\" src=\"http:\/\/www.dwmkerr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/buildbuttons.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"388\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nNow choose the kind of buttons you want, in this example we'll select 'Social Media' from the top menu:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.dwmkerr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/socialmedia.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-305\" alt=\"Social Media Buttons\" src=\"http:\/\/www.dwmkerr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/socialmedia.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"472\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nOn each category page, there's a list of the different types of buttons that can be built. Social Media includes the 'Share' button set. Click 'Build It!':\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.dwmkerr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/sharebuttons.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-304\" alt=\"Social Media Button Settings\" src=\"http:\/\/www.dwmkerr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/sharebuttons.jpg\" width=\"733\" height=\"589\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nNow just fill in the details to customise your buttons, enter a URL and select the sort of buttons you want to include. When you're ready to see how your buttons look, choose 'Build it!':\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.dwmkerr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/results.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-303\" alt=\"Build Buttons Results\" src=\"http:\/\/www.dwmkerr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/results.jpg\" width=\"597\" height=\"401\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nYou get a working preview of how your buttons look, and a text box that includes the HTML you need to drop into your webpage or blog, easy!\r\n\r\nBuild Buttons has quite a few different types of buttons you can create.
