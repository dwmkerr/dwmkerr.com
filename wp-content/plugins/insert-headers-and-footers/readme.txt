This plugin allows you to add extra scripts to the header and footer of your blog by hooking into wp_head and wp_footer.

== Description ==

Insert Headers and Footers is a simple plugin that lets you add scripts like Google Analytics to your WordPress site without having to get your hands dirty in code. Moreover, the simple interface gives you one place where you can add all of you scripts rather than dealing with dozens of plugins.

If you enjoy using this plugin and want to learn more about how to use WordPress then I would suggest visiting [WPBeginner](http://www.wpbeginner.com "WPBeginner"). It's one of the largest free WordPress resource sites in the world and has tons of [WordPress tutorials](http://www.wpbeginner.com/category/wp-tutorials/ "WordPress tutorials") that will explain everything you need to know about setting up and using WordPress. 

On the site you will also find [free WordPress video tutorials](http://videos.wpbeginner.com "Checkout out WPBeginner's WordPress tutorial videos"), and numerous other guides such as [how to choose the best WordPress hosting](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wordpress-hosting/ "How to Choose the Best WordPress Web Hosting"), [how to install WordPress](http://www.wpbeginner.com/how-to-install-wordpress/ "How to install WordPress") and many more.

People often ask me what are the [best WordPress plugins](http://www.wpbeginner.com/category/plugins/ "best WordPress plugins")? How do I decide which plugins I should use on my site? Are there any must have plugins? To answer all these questions I created a blueprint of WPBeginner that shows exactly what I use to run the site.

Note for Beginners: Like all plugins available for download, Insert Headers And Footers is only available for self-hosted WordPress sites. This means you will need to [switch from WordPress.com to WordPress.org](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-properly-move-your-blog-from-wordpress-com-to-wordpress-org/ "switch from WordPress.com to WordPress.org") if you want to use this plugin on your WordPress site.
