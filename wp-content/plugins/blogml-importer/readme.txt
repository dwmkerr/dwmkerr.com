Import posts, comments, users, and categories from a BlogML file.

== Description ==

Import posts, comments, users, and categories from a BlogML file. 

Based on BlogML importer written by Aaron Lerch (http://www.aaronlerch.com/) and modified to work with Wordpress 3.0.

Note: Plugin may not import categories or tags properly into WordPress. For instance,
during my install there were no tags installed, and the categories were defined as GUIDs.
A simple rename and retag fixed this issue.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the 'blogml-importer.zip' file using the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
2. Activate the plugin.
3. Go to the Tools -> Import screen, Click on BlogML.
4. Follow the directions to complete the process.
