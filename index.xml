However, knowing the basics can help prevent you from getting yourself into a tangle, and can from time to time make certain tasks a little easier.
In this chapter, we'll look at the main features of job control, why it can be a problematic, and some alternatives.

I've seen a few ways of doing this, none of which felt entirely satisfactory. After a bit of experimentation I've come up with a solution which I think really works nicely. This solution avoids having to know in advance how many availability zones we'll support.</description></item><item><title>A portable and magic-free way to open Pull Requests from the Command Line</title><link>http://example.org/a-portable-and-magic-free-way-to-open-pull-requests-from-the-command-line/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Oct 2018 09:17:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/a-portable-and-magic-free-way-to-open-pull-requests-from-the-command-line/</guid><description>This little bash snippet will let you open a GitHub or GitLab pull request from the command line on most Unix-like systems (OSX, Ubuntu, etc), without using any magic libraries, ZSH tricks or other dependencies.

No knowledge of Istio is needed, I'll just use it to demonstrate the concepts!
Istio is a highly popular Service Mesh platform which allows engineers to quickly add telemetry, advanced traffic management and more to their service-based applications.
One interesting element of how Istio works is that when deployed into a Kubernetes cluster, many key configuration objects are handled as Custom Resources.</description></item><item><title>Procedural Smiles - Animating SVG with pure JavaScript</title><link>http://example.org/procedural-smiles-animating-svg-with-pure-javascript/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jul 2018 23:36:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/procedural-smiles-animating-svg-with-pure-javascript/</guid><description>I recently needed to be able to generate a simple face image, with the face being able to scale from happy to sad.

Controllers Filters Directives Services Views &amp;amp; Routes We‚Äôre not going to be going into detail ‚Äì just taking a look at what each of these components are and where they fit into the structure of an app. We‚Äôll be going into detail for each of them in later articles.</description></item><item><title>Practical AngularJS</title><link>http://example.org/practical-angularjs/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2014 14:48:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/practical-angularjs/</guid><description>This series focuses on building applications with AngularJS. It assumes no prior knowledge.
Part 1 ‚Äì Introducing AngularJS
What is AngularJS? What‚Äôs it for and when should we use it? We look into the basics of AngularJS ‚Äì controllers, models and scopes, as well as how to use common directives like ng-model and ng-repeat. We see how client side logic is improved with AngularJS and how we can handle unit testing.</description></item><item><title>AngularJS Promises - The Definitive Guide</title><link>http://example.org/promises-in-angularjs-the-definitive-guide/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2014 12:06:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/promises-in-angularjs-the-definitive-guide/</guid><description>Promises are a core feature of AngularJS - whether you understand them or not, if you use AngularJS you've almost certainly been using them for a while.
In this post I'm going to explain what promises are, how they work, where they're used and finally how to use them effectively.
Once we've got the core understanding of promises, we'll look at some more advanced functionality - chaining and resolving promises when routing.</description></item><item><title>Better Specifications</title><link>http://example.org/better-specifications/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2014 14:58:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/better-specifications/</guid><description>Specifications are absolutely key to the success of a project.
Unless you have a good definition of what your project is supposed to be, there's no way you can deliver it. A specification is the contract between you and the client, the basis for technical designs, quality assurance test plans, operational readiness, and much more.
I'm not going to talk about how different teams do specs, what works and what doesn't work.</description></item><item><title>Blogging with Ghost</title><link>http://example.org/blogging-with-ghost/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2014 04:35:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/blogging-with-ghost/</guid><description>tl;dr Ghost is a blogging platform well worth considering if your blog is all about development.
I've been having some gripes with WordPress as a platform for blogging lately. For development focused blogs like this one, there are some things about it that make writing posts just a little bit clunky. For example:
Syntax Higlightling is always going to use plugins with various shortcode formats. This works, but your raw blog text becomes quite specific to a certain implementation.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>http://example.org/page/about/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 May 2014 14:59:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/page/about/</guid><description>I have been developing software for many years.

We'll see how AngularJS can be used to speed up your development and help you write cleaner, more testable code.
Introducing AngularJS First of all an introduction is in order.
AngularJS is a lightweight JavaScript framework, primarily for building single page web applications. The idea behind applications like these is that rather than the &amp;lsquo;traditional&amp;rsquo; way of writing web applications which would involve using server side technologies to render the user interface and send it to the user, we handle all of the presentation logic on the client side.</description></item><item><title>Managing Vsix Deployments with Powershell</title><link>http://example.org/managing-vsix-deployments-with-powershell/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2014 11:40:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/managing-vsix-deployments-with-powershell/</guid><description>tl;dr - vsix-tools fixes the &amp;lsquo;Invalid Multiple Files in VSIX&amp;rsquo; issue on the Visual Studio Gallery and lets you set vsix version numbers with Powershell.
I maintain a reasonably large project called SharpGL. This project contains two Vsix packages (Visual Studio Extensions), each of which contains project templates for Visual Studio.
If you have ever worked with Vsix files before you might have noticed that the tools for them in Visual Studio seem a little flaky - but even more so is that Visual Studio Gallery site that you have to use to upload your extensions.</description></item><item><title>Practical AngularJS Part 2</title><link>http://example.org/practical-angularjs-part-2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2014 15:29:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/practical-angularjs-part-2/</guid><description>I'm going to be working in F# almost exclusively for a short while, so before I throw myself into that I wanted to wind up my Practical AngularJS Part 2 article. It's ready to rock here:
Practical AngularJS Part 2 - Components of an AngularJS ApplicationIn this article we get a brief introduction to what's in the toolkit for an angular developers - filters, controllers, services, directives, views and routes. I don't go into too much detail, we're just seeing what the different components are.</description></item><item><title>Langton's Ant in Javascript</title><link>http://example.org/langtons-ant-in-javascript/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Dec 2013 10:47:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/langtons-ant-in-javascript/</guid><description>Langton's Ant is a great simulation to write to play with a language. Just today I've completed my Langton's Ant write up and published it on the CodeProject, you can see the article at Learn JavaScript Part 3 - Angularjs and Langton's Ant.

I've had a chance to work a little with Backbone and KnockoutJS and had been recently deliberately holding off looking at AngularJS so I could hit the conference and workshops fresh and unencumbered with any preconceptions.
The sessions were great, and since then I've been working on a couple of projects that use Angular.</description></item><item><title>Space Invaders on the CodeProject</title><link>http://example.org/space-invaders-on-the-codeproject/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2013 12:24:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/space-invaders-on-the-codeproject/</guid><description>I'm currently writing a series of articles on the CodeProject called &amp;lsquo;Learn JavaScript&amp;rsquo; and am pleased to say that the latest article is available now!

This release has been primarily a bugfixing release, but there is one very useful new feature, the Server Registration Manager tool (srm.exe). This is a standalone application that can be used to install and uninstall SharpShell servers.
This tool makes it much easier to deploy SharpShell servers. You can call the tool as a Custom Action in a MSI project, either by using Visual Studio 2010's installer project type, or a WiX project.</description></item><item><title>ConsoleControl and Happy Coders</title><link>http://example.org/consolecontrol-and-happy-coders/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Sep 2013 13:27:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/consolecontrol-and-happy-coders/</guid><description>Sometimes I write up an article and some code on the CodeProject and get a good response, other times it seems an article sinks beneath the waves without any notice.

Recursive read lock acquisitions not allowed in this mode.I'm lost on the root cause of this, but it does seem that the project I'm working on has files set to read-only by something regularly, perhaps Visual Studio is trying to make Git more TFS-y by locking things all over the place.

If you're developing addins for multiple versions of Visual Studio - don't use WPF for the Tools &amp;gt; Options windows. It's just noit going to place nice out of the box. This is because there's a lot of property page Win32 stuff going on in the host window that makes it hard to route messages properly - keyboard entry won't work correctly, tab order will be messed up and more, it's just not worth the pain.</description></item><item><title>Introducing Sil</title><link>http://example.org/introducing-sil/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jun 2013 15:35:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/introducing-sil/</guid><description>For the last few weeks I've been trying to tie up a project I've been working on for a while called Sil.

When I moved onto a new, Windows based server, I decided that as I was running MSSQL Server and IIS on it, I would move my personal blog onto an ASP based platform - for this I chose BlogEngine.</description></item><item><title>The GAC Manager</title><link>http://example.org/the-gac-manager/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jul 2012 08:44:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/the-gac-manager/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Changing Merge/Compare Tools in TFS</title><link>http://example.org/changing-mergecompare-tools-in-tfs/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jun 2012 07:56:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/changing-mergecompare-tools-in-tfs/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Go Offline Extension for Visual Studio 2010</title><link>http://example.org/go-offline-extension-for-visual-studio-2010/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jun 2012 10:54:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/go-offline-extension-for-visual-studio-2010/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Samsung to develop software in-house</title><link>http://example.org/samsung-to-develop-software-in-house/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 May 2012 04:57:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/samsung-to-develop-software-in-house/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Apex Part 2 - Adding Commands to an MVVM Application</title><link>http://example.org/apex-part-2-adding-commands-to-an-mvvm-application/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 May 2012 07:43:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/apex-part-2-adding-commands-to-an-mvvm-application/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Apex Part 1 - Getting Started with the Apex SDK</title><link>http://example.org/apex-part-1-getting-started-with-the-apex-sdk/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Apr 2012 05:35:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/apex-part-1-getting-started-with-the-apex-sdk/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Come on MS - Improve MFC</title><link>http://example.org/come-on-ms-improve-mfc/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Apr 2012 09:02:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/come-on-ms-improve-mfc/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Could not load file or assembly 'System.Windows, Version=2.0.5.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=7cec85d7bea7798e' or one of its dependencies.</title><link>http://example.org/could-not-load-file-or-assembly-system-windows-version2-0-5-0-cultureneutral-publickeytoken7cec85d7bea7798e-or-one-of-its-dependencies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Apr 2012 07:55:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/could-not-load-file-or-assembly-system-windows-version2-0-5-0-cultureneutral-publickeytoken7cec85d7bea7798e-or-one-of-its-dependencies/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Create Item Templates in Visual Studio</title><link>http://example.org/create-item-templates-in-visual-studio/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Apr 2012 06:29:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/create-item-templates-in-visual-studio/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Embedding a Console in a C# application</title><link>http://example.org/embedding-a-console-in-a-c-application/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Feb 2012 05:29:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/embedding-a-console-in-a-c-application/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Disabling Constraints with a Stored Procedure in Oracle</title><link>http://example.org/disabling-constraints-with-a-stored-procedure-in-oracle/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Feb 2012 06:20:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/disabling-constraints-with-a-stored-procedure-in-oracle/</guid><description/></item><item><title>SharpGL 2.0</title><link>http://example.org/sharpgl-2-0/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Feb 2012 03:42:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/sharpgl-2-0/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Using imp or exp as a SYSDBA</title><link>http://example.org/using-imp-or-exp-as-a-sysdba/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Feb 2012 07:21:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/using-imp-or-exp-as-a-sysdba/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Debugger:: An unhandled non-continuable exception was thrown during process load</title><link>http://example.org/debugger-an-unhandled-non-continuable-exception-was-thrown-during-process-load/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Feb 2012 06:54:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/debugger-an-unhandled-non-continuable-exception-was-thrown-during-process-load/</guid><description>// Exported class class MY_API MyClass { public:
