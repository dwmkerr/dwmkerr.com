I've had a chance to work a little with Backbone and KnockoutJS and had been recently deliberately holding off looking at AngularJS so I could hit the conference and workshops fresh and unencumbered with any preconceptions.
The sessions were great, and since then I've been working on a couple of projects that use Angular.</description></item><item><title>Getting Paths for Files in NUnit Tests</title><link>https://dwmkerr.com/getting-paths-for-files-in-nunit-tests/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2013 05:22:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dwmkerr.com/getting-paths-for-files-in-nunit-tests/</guid><description>When using NUnit, sometimes you will want to access files in the test project. These might be xml files with data, assembly references or whatever. Now typically, NUnit will actually copy the files it thinks it needs into a temporary location. This causes the problem that you can then do things like use a relative path to get files in the project. You can use manifest resource streams but sometimes this just isn't suitable.</description></item></channel></rss>
