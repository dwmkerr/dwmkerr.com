I wrote about it on the CodeProject, in an article called Solitaire and Spider Solitaire for WPF (imaginative title indeed).
Anyway, just recently I got a very interesting message from rupam rupam, who has made an augmented reality version of the project! In his application, you use your webcam to play the game physically by picking up cards with gestures.</description></item><item><title>Apex Part 2 - Adding Commands to an MVVM Application</title><link>https://dwmkerr.com/apex-part-2-adding-commands-to-an-mvvm-application/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 May 2012 07:43:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dwmkerr.com/apex-part-2-adding-commands-to-an-mvvm-application/</guid><description>In Part 2 of my video tutorial series on using Apex I show you how you can add commands to an MVVM application.
