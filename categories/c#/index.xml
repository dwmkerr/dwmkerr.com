Holiday may not be the right term really, I'm mostly working through charity stuff (for my charity Namaste - Children's Homes Nepal) and company administration. I'm also starting working on a big new project, which is pretty exciting.
Anyway, I got a nice message from a fellow coder George Hahn who has put together a pretty cool project that lets you send files directly to Trello as an attachment to a card, or even as a new card.</description></item><item><title>Build Buttons for Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, GitHub and More!</title><link>https://dwmkerr.com/build-buttons-for-facebook-twitter-linkedin-github-and-more/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jun 2013 02:34:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dwmkerr.com/build-buttons-for-facebook-twitter-linkedin-github-and-more/</guid><description>Recently I've been working on a small project called Build Buttons. Build Buttons is a website that let's you quickly create buttons for sharing and promoting content. You can use Build Buttons to create Facebook &amp;lsquo;Like&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;Follow&amp;rsquo; buttons, LinkedIn &amp;lsquo;Share&amp;rsquo; buttons, Google +1 buttons, GitHub Star, Fork and Follow buttons and more. Here's how it works.
First, go to www.buildbuttons.com:
Now choose the kind of buttons you want, in this example we'll select &amp;lsquo;Social Media&amp;rsquo; from the top menu:</description></item><item><title>Getting Paths for Files in NUnit Tests</title><link>https://dwmkerr.com/getting-paths-for-files-in-nunit-tests/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2013 05:22:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dwmkerr.com/getting-paths-for-files-in-nunit-tests/</guid><description>When using NUnit, sometimes you will want to access files in the test project. These might be xml files with data, assembly references or whatever. Now typically, NUnit will actually copy the files it thinks it needs into a temporary location. This causes the problem that you can then do things like use a relative path to get files in the project. You can use manifest resource streams but sometimes this just isn't suitable.</description></item><item><title>Introducing FireKeys</title><link>https://dwmkerr.com/introducing-firekeys/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Mar 2013 11:11:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dwmkerr.com/introducing-firekeys/</guid><description>I don't know when I learnt that Windows + E opened up Windows Explorer. It must have been a while ago. But it's imprinted in my muscle memory, the number of times I hit that combo every day is probably quite high. But how many other hotkeys do I use? Asides from a few other functional ones, like Win + D, I don't use hotkeys so much. And I got to thinking, I'd love to open Google Chrome with a hotkey just like I do with explorer.</description></item><item><title>Spider Solitaire and Augmented Reality</title><link>https://dwmkerr.com/spider-solitaire-and-augmented-reality/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Feb 2013 16:16:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dwmkerr.com/spider-solitaire-and-augmented-reality/</guid><description>A while ago, I made an implementation of Solitaire and Spider Solitaire using WPF and my Apex MVVM library. I wrote about it on the CodeProject, in an article called Solitaire and Spider Solitaire for WPF (imaginative title indeed).
Anyway, just recently I got a very interesting message from rupam rupam, who has made an augmented reality version of the project! In his application, you use your webcam to play the game physically by picking up cards with gestures.</description></item><item><title>Creating Info Tip Handlers with .NET</title><link>https://dwmkerr.com/creating-info-tip-handlers-with-net/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jan 2013 03:47:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dwmkerr.com/creating-info-tip-handlers-with-net/</guid><description>I have just added an article to the CodeProject that discusses how to create Info Tip shell extensions in .NET. These extensions are used by the shell to customise the tooltips shown over shell items.
The article shows how you can use SharpShell to very quickly create these extensions, you can find it at:Â http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/527058/NET-Shell-Extensions-Shell-Info-Tip-Handlers.
So just how easy does SharpShell make creating Shell Info Tip Handlers? The answer is pretty easy indeed.</description></item><item><title>SharpShell</title><link>https://dwmkerr.com/sharpshell/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jan 2013 16:28:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dwmkerr.com/sharpshell/</guid><description>SharpShell is a project that I have recently uploaded to CodePlex. This class library, and set of tools and samples, is designed to be a framework to enable rapid development of Shell Extensions using the .NET Framework. In time it may grow to contain some functionality for using Shell entities within managed applications (for example, allowing an Explorer context menu to be built dynamically for a given path).
Anyway, the code is all at sharpshell.</description></item><item><title>The GAC Manager</title><link>https://dwmkerr.com/the-gac-manager/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jul 2012 08:44:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dwmkerr.com/the-gac-manager/</guid><description>I have started a new project on CodePlex called 'GAC Manager'.

An Asynchronous Command is a ViewModelCommand - the standard object used in Apex for commanding. However, what is different about this function is that it runs Asynchronously.
One of the problems with running a view model command asynchronously is that generally the view model properties cannot be accessed - as they're created on a different dispatcher.</description></item><item><title>CodeProject Competition</title><link>https://dwmkerr.com/codeproject-competition/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Oct 2011 07:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dwmkerr.com/codeproject-competition/</guid><description>My Solitaire and Spider Solitaire in WPF article is in two CodeProject competitions this month.

This isn't done via a WinFormsHost (which has unpleasant side-effects due to Airspace, see&amp;nbsp;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa970688(v=VS.100).aspx) but actually via an Image in a WPF UserControl.
What does this mean?

OpenGL offers a function called&amp;nbsp;wglGetProcAddress which can return the address of a named function - but how do we deal with this in the managed world?
Here's a brief description of how it's handled in SharpGL.</description></item><item><title>How ISupportInitialize Can Help</title><link>https://dwmkerr.com/how-isupportinitialize-can-help/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Sep 2011 14:49:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dwmkerr.com/how-isupportinitialize-can-help/</guid><description>I have recently come to discover the ISupportInitialize interface and found that it is extremely useful when developing more complicated WinForms controls.
Here's the link to the interface on MSDN: ISupportInitialize - here I'll describe how it can be useful.
The Problem I have a fairly complicated WinForms usercontrol called 'OpenGLControl', which allows OpenGL commands to be used to render 3D scenes in a C# WinForms application.

This means there's no more importing of PIXELFORMAT structures and so on.
The thinking behind this was that a C++/CLI wrapper is faster than P/Invoke for a talkative API like OpenGL - but is this actually the case? In my new article on the CodeProject I investigate the performance differences between these two methods.</description></item><item><title>Trials and Tribulations with SharpGL 2.0</title><link>https://dwmkerr.com/trials-and-tribulations-with-sharpgl-2-0/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Sep 2011 06:03:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dwmkerr.com/trials-and-tribulations-with-sharpgl-2-0/</guid><description>SharpGL has not been updated for a while, the original CoreProject article is at: http://www.codeproject.com/KB/openGL/sharpgl.aspx
