I've created a new version of Switch (1.4) and uploaded this - it works fine now, for Visual Studio 2008, 2010 and 2012.
You can find out more about this extension on the Switch Page.</description></item><item><title>The Visual Studio Experimental Instance</title><link>https://dwmkerr.com/the-visual-studio-experimental-instance/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Feb 2013 14:41:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dwmkerr.com/the-visual-studio-experimental-instance/</guid><description>Working on some addins lately has taught me a few really useful tricks about debugging in Visual Studio. I'll update this post over time.
The Experimental InstanceVery useful to know - the experimental instance loads its extensions from a special folder, and debugging extensions drops them there. The location is:
%UserProfile%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\VisualStudio\10.0Exp\Extensions\</description></item></channel></rss>
