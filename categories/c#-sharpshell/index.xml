This release has been primarily a bugfixing release, but there is one very useful new feature, the Server Registration Manager tool (srm.exe). This is a standalone application that can be used to install and uninstall SharpShell servers.
This tool makes it much easier to deploy SharpShell servers. You can call the tool as a Custom Action in a MSI project, either by using Visual Studio 2010's installer project type, or a WiX project.</description></item></channel></rss>
