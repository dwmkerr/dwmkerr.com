https://effective-shell.com
The whole site is built from a GitHub repo at github.com/dwmkerr/effective-shell. It is open for contributions, changes, issues and suggestions. I've also added a comment section to each page to get input.
To keep the material as accessible as possible, I have added a new section for beginners, to help anyone who has not used a shell before.</description></item><item><title>Effective Shell Part 7: The Subtleties of Shell Commands</title><link>https://dwmkerr.com/effective-shell-7-shell-commands/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jun 2019 07:25:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dwmkerr.com/effective-shell-7-shell-commands/</guid><description>In this chapter, we'll take a look at the various different types of shell commands that exist and how this can affect your work.

Input
Line 1 Line 2 Line 3 Output
[ {line: &amp;quot;Line 1&amp;quot;}, {line: &amp;quot;Line 2&amp;quot;}, {line: &amp;quot;Line 3&amp;quot;} ] There's a bit more to it than that, but that's the gist.
I want to test my service with cURL, trying:
curl --data &amp;quot;Line 1\nLine 2\nLine 3&amp;quot; \ -H &amp;quot;Content-Type: text/plain&amp;quot; localhost:3000/parse This did not work.</description></item></channel></rss>
