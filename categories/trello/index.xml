Holiday may not be the right term really, I'm mostly working through charity stuff (for my charity Namaste - Children's Homes Nepal) and company administration. I'm also starting working on a big new project, which is pretty exciting.
Anyway, I got a nice message from a fellow coder George Hahn who has put together a pretty cool project that lets you send files directly to Trello as an attachment to a card, or even as a new card.</description></item></channel></rss>
