&lt;p>&lt;strong>tl;dr&lt;/strong> - &lt;a href="https://github.com/dwmkerr/vsix-tools">vsix-tools&lt;/a> fixes the &amp;lsquo;Invalid Multiple Files in VSIX&amp;rsquo; issue on the Visual Studio Gallery and lets you set vsix version numbers with Powershell.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I maintain a reasonably large project called SharpGL. This project contains two Vsix packages (Visual Studio Extensions), each of which contains project templates for Visual Studio.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have ever worked with Vsix files before you might have noticed that the tools for them in Visual Studio seem a little flaky - but even more so is that Visual Studio Gallery site that you have to use to upload your extensions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Add more than one project template to your Vsix and try and upload it - this is what you&amp;rsquo;ll see:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.dwmkerr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/InvalidMultipleZipFilesInVsix.jpg">&lt;img src="images/InvalidMultipleZipFilesInVsix.jpg" alt="InvalidMultipleZipFilesInVsix" width="263" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a pain to solve this problem - basically you need to change the folder structure within the vsix file, then change the xml that describes it. Now this is not too much of a problem if you do it once or twice, but if you&amp;rsquo;re in the situation where you want to be able to build a release of your code rapidly, including extensions, this will seriously slow you down.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Enter &lt;a href="https://github.com/dwmkerr/vsix-tools">VsixTools&lt;/a>, a little Powershell script that lets you resolve this issue and as a bonus lets you set the version in the Vsix as well - very useful for scripts that build releases. You can use it like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code># Load vsix tools
. VsixTools.ps1
# Set the version number of &amp;#39;MyPackage&amp;#39; and fix the zip issue for uploading to the gallery.
$vsixPath = &amp;#34;c:/MyPackage.vsix&amp;#34;
Vsix-SetVersion -VsixPath $vsixPath -Version &amp;#34;2.2.0.1&amp;#34;
Vsix-FixInvalidMultipleFiles -VsixPath $vsixPath&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>This Powershell script has no dependencies, it&amp;rsquo;s just Powershell 2.0. Get the script at &lt;a href="https://github.com/dwmkerr/vsix-tools">github.com/dwmkerr/vsix-tools&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It works for package manifests of version 1 or 2 - for anyone who&amp;rsquo;s lucky enough to have not had to delve into the internals of this that means that it works from Visual Studio 2010 onwards.&lt;/p></description><category>CodeProject</category></item></channel></rss>
