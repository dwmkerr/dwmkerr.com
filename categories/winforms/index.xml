Recently however, I came across a situation that you should just avoid.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you're developing addins for multiple versions of Visual Studio - don't use WPF for the Tools &amp;gt; Options windows. It's just noit going to place nice out of the box. This is because there's a lot of property page Win32 stuff going on in the host window that makes it hard to route messages properly - keyboard entry won't work correctly, tab order will be messed up and more, it's just not worth the pain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you're developing addins for later versions of Visual Studio, you can actually use the VSPackage functionality to build options pages with WPF with ease, just check &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.visualstudio.shell.uielementdialogpage.aspx" target="_blank">UIElementDialogPage&lt;/a>. In fact, read the article here:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a title="Creating Option Pages by using MPF" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb165039.aspx" target="_blank">Creating Options Pages by using MPF &lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Final thoughts on this - if you want the functionality above in VS2010, you can get it (as long as you use MPF) by checking this page:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vsx/thread/6af9718e-8778-4233-875d-b38c03e9f4ba" target="_blank">Unable to access WPF User Control in Options Dialog&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You'll see that about halfway down, Ryan Moulden has posted some code from Microsoft for the UIElementDialogPage, you can use that you get the functionality in VS2010.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Any other versions, or for a addin installed by an MSI, it's probably best to stick with WinForms.&lt;/p>
