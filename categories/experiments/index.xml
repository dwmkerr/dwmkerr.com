Space Invaders is a great little game to code if you're learning a new language or technology (and JavaScript is still very much in that category for me). I'll be writing up how I made the game on the CodeProject soon enough (if you're interested you can see how I made the starfield background in JavaScript).</description></item><item><title>Introducing Experiments</title><link>https://dwmkerr.com/introducing-experiments/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Aug 2013 06:00:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dwmkerr.com/introducing-experiments/</guid><description>I'm staring a series of articles on learning Javascript (the first is available atÂ http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/642499/Learn-JavaScript-Part-1-Create-a-Starfield). To help with this, I've created the Experimentspage. This page will host each of the things I've been playing with in the process of learning JavaScript and coming up with good topics for tutorials.
You can see the Experimentspage here, there's also a link at the top of the site. If you like it, please feel free to comment on this post or get in touch.</description></item></channel></rss>
