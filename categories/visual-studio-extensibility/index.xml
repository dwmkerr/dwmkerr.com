&lt;p>&lt;strong>tl;dr&lt;/strong> - &lt;a href="https://github.com/dwmkerr/vsix-tools">vsix-tools&lt;/a> fixes the &amp;lsquo;Invalid Multiple Files in VSIX&amp;rsquo; issue on the Visual Studio Gallery and lets you set vsix version numbers with Powershell.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I maintain a reasonably large project called SharpGL. This project contains two Vsix packages (Visual Studio Extensions), each of which contains project templates for Visual Studio.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have ever worked with Vsix files before you might have noticed that the tools for them in Visual Studio seem a little flaky - but even more so is that Visual Studio Gallery site that you have to use to upload your extensions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Add more than one project template to your Vsix and try and upload it - this is what you'll see:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.dwmkerr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/InvalidMultipleZipFilesInVsix.jpg">&lt;img src="images/InvalidMultipleZipFilesInVsix.jpg" alt="InvalidMultipleZipFilesInVsix" width="263" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It's a pain to solve this problem - basically you need to change the folder structure within the vsix file, then change the xml that describes it. Now this is not too much of a problem if you do it once or twice, but if you're in the situation where you want to be able to build a release of your code rapidly, including extensions, this will seriously slow you down.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Enter &lt;a href="https://github.com/dwmkerr/vsix-tools">VsixTools&lt;/a>, a little Powershell script that lets you resolve this issue and as a bonus lets you set the version in the Vsix as well - very useful for scripts that build releases. You can use it like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code># Load vsix tools
. VsixTools.ps1
# Set the version number of 'MyPackage' and fix the zip issue for uploading to the gallery.
$vsixPath = &amp;quot;c:/MyPackage.vsix&amp;quot;
Vsix-SetVersion -VsixPath $vsixPath -Version &amp;quot;2.2.0.1&amp;quot;
Vsix-FixInvalidMultipleFiles -VsixPath $vsixPath&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>This Powershell script has no dependencies, it's just Powershell 2.0. Get the script at &lt;a href="https://github.com/dwmkerr/vsix-tools">github.com/dwmkerr/vsix-tools&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It works for package manifests of version 1 or 2 - for anyone who's lucky enough to have not had to delve into the internals of this that means that it works from Visual Studio 2010 onwards.&lt;/p></description><category>CodeProject</category></item><item><title>WPF and Visual Studio Addins</title><link>https://dwmkerr.com/wpf-and-visual-studio-addins/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jun 2013 01:36:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dwmkerr.com/wpf-and-visual-studio-addins/</guid><description>&lt;p>If at all possible nowadays, I write all my Windows UI code in WPF, it's just quicker and easier than WinForms. Recently however, I came across a situation that you should just avoid.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you're developing addins for multiple versions of Visual Studio - don't use WPF for the Tools &amp;gt; Options windows. It's just noit going to place nice out of the box. This is because there's a lot of property page Win32 stuff going on in the host window that makes it hard to route messages properly - keyboard entry won't work correctly, tab order will be messed up and more, it's just not worth the pain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you're developing addins for later versions of Visual Studio, you can actually use the VSPackage functionality to build options pages with WPF with ease, just check &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.visualstudio.shell.uielementdialogpage.aspx" target="_blank">UIElementDialogPage&lt;/a>. In fact, read the article here:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a title="Creating Option Pages by using MPF" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb165039.aspx" target="_blank">Creating Options Pages by using MPF &lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Final thoughts on this - if you want the functionality above in VS2010, you can get it (as long as you use MPF) by checking this page:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vsx/thread/6af9718e-8778-4233-875d-b38c03e9f4ba" target="_blank">Unable to access WPF User Control in Options Dialog&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You'll see that about halfway down, Ryan Moulden has posted some code from Microsoft for the UIElementDialogPage, you can use that you get the functionality in VS2010.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Any other versions, or for a addin installed by an MSI, it's probably best to stick with WinForms.&lt;/p>
