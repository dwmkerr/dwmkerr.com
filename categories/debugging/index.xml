Could not load file or assembly 'System.Windows, Version=2.0.5.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=7cec85d7bea7798e' or
one of its dependencies. It's a bit of an odd one. The solution that works for me is to re-register System.Core and System.Windows in the GAC. Use the commands below.
32 Bit System
"C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0A\bin\NETFX 4.0 Tools\gacutil" /i "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Silverlight\4.1.10111.0\System.Core.dll"

Debugger:: An unhandled non-continuable exception was thrown during process load here's some tips if you get it.
Are you linking to winmm.lib? If so avoid it - it can cause these problems. Are you delay-loading the module? If not, try it - this can often resolve this issue if other modules like winmm.lib are interfering with the module that causes this exception.</description></item><item><title>How to Debug a Visual Studio Extension</title><link>https://dwmkerr.com/how-to-debug-a-visual-studio-extension/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Nov 2011 11:11:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dwmkerr.com/how-to-debug-a-visual-studio-extension/</guid><description>Here are a few tips for debugging Visual Studio Extensions.
Visual Studio 2008/2010
If you need to debug your Visual Studio extension, you may find that Visual Studio itself locks it. This is a real drag - to resolve this issue, add the following as a pre-build step:
if exist "$(TargetPath).locked" del "$(TargetPath).locked" if not exist "$(TargetPath).locked" if exist "$(TargetPath)" move "$(TargetPath)" "$(TargetPath).locked" This will ensure the locked file is moved out of the way first - very useful!</description></item><item><title>Visual Studio Code Analysis - Buffer Overruns</title><link>https://dwmkerr.com/visual-studio-code-analysis-buffer-overruns/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Sep 2011 13:55:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dwmkerr.com/visual-studio-code-analysis-buffer-overruns/</guid><description>Today I was looking through some fairly old source code in a large solution, large in this case is ~300 projects and about 1 million lines of code. Parts of the code base are very old - at some stage a decision was made to disable warning C4996. The problem I came across is reduced to its most simple form below:
