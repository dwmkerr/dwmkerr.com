&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;span style="line-height: 14px;">Visual Studio 2012&lt;/span>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Visual Studio Tools for Git&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nuget&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
Then you may encounter some weird problems when trying to update Nuget packages. For me, updates regularly fail with:
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Recursive read lock acquisitions not allowed in this mode.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I'm lost on the root cause of this, but it does seem that the project I'm working on has files set to read-only by something regularly, perhaps Visual Studio is trying to make Git more TFS-y by locking things all over the place. Whatever the cause, I've found that the following usually helps:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;span style="line-height: 14px;">Don't use Update-Package - use Install-Package instead.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Make sure the solution has all of its files read+write, not read only.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Open the team explorer and go to 'Commits' - making sure that the Git tools have loaded various components.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;span style="line-height: 20px;">This combination of tricks seems to solve the problem. If anyone has any other ideas or suggestions, just comment.&lt;/span></description><category>CodeProject</category></item></channel></rss>
