I'm a technology expert working at [QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/how-we-help-clients) in London.

My journey started with C and C++, writing device drivers, then moved through .NET and a little F#, into JavaScript and Node.js/TypeScript, with Python along the way. Plenty of bash, spit and glue, vim and tmux. For most of my time at McKinsey and QuantumBlack I have been building cloud-native distributed systems, mainly for financial institutions. Nowadays it's a tonne of AI.
